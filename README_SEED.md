# Seeding Sanity demo content

To seed the demo content into your Sanity project, you can use a simple Node script or the Sanity import tool.

Example: using Sanity CLI (after you create a project and have `sanity` installed):

1. Save the JSON payload in `sanity/seed/demo-data.json`
2. Use the Sanity import command to import events and officers, or run a small script to create documents via the Sanity client.
